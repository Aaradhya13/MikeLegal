# Daily Task Manager

A React application for managing daily tasks with calendar interface and data visualization.

## Assignment Overview

This project is built as per the requirements to create a task management application using React and Ant Design. The app allows users to add, view, and categorize tasks on a calendar interface, and visualize them through charts.

## Features Implemented

- Uses Ant Design's `<Calendar />` component
- Allows clicking on any date to view or add tasks
- Shows task indicators on dates with existing tasks

### 2. Add/Edit Task
- Modal form with Formik + Yup validation
- Fields: Title (required), Description (optional), Date (auto-filled), Category dropdown
- Categories: success, warning, issue, info
- Form validation using Yup
- Tasks stored in Redux Toolkit state

### 3. Task Listing
- Displays tasks for the selected date
- Each task has Edit and Delete options
- Categories displayed using Ant Design Tags with color coding
- Today's tasks and upcoming tasks sections

### 4. Chart Visualization
- Bar and Pie charts showing task counts per category
- Dropdown filters to filter by category
- Apply and Reset buttons for filtering
- Charts update based on selected filters
